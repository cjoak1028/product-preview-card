## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing new in particular. I committed myself to this project to get my gears running again.

### Continued development

For this project in particular, I wanted to use vanilla CSS to revisit the fundamentals of CSS. Moving forward, I'll be exploring and utilizing popular tools such as SASS/SCSS and Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-tricks) - This helped me refresh my memory of Flexbox. Flexbox is my default choice for layout model :).
